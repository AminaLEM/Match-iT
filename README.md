# Match-iT
Unbalanced Mapping Approach for High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics
![Workflow](https://github.com/AminaLEM/Match-iT/blob/main/Algorithm.png)


# Overview
The notebook main_annotate.ipynb shows how to annotate High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics data with high accuracy using a reference dataset.
The following is the structure of the package:

- **`src/ot_annotator.py`**: Used for subclustering and OT mapping.
- **`src/plot_hp.py`**: Used to plot hyperparameters scatterplot.
- **`src/compare_viz.py`**: Used to evaluate results (comparison to other methods and visualization).
